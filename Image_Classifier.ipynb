    " # Number Guessing Game\n",
    "   - Refresh the basics of machine learning by creating a number guessing game. Here the algorithm is implemented to guess the      number the user is thinking of.\n",
    "   - This code implements a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "   - The user is prompted to guess the number.\n",
    "   - If the user's guess is too low, the program notifies them and asks for another guess.\n",
    "   - If the guess is too high, it does the same.\n",
    "   - If the user guesses correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed."
